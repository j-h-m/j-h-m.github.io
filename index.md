# About me 

I'm a software developer currently employed in Tennessee.

I have volunteered on a few projects with The Herbarium Consortium at UTC in Chattanooga. [CapPow](https://github.com/CapPow) and I are working on a pair of applications for field research.
One is a data processing application powered by Python and another is a Xamarin Forms project that will result in an Android and iOS application. They will allow plant collectors to easily gather collection information in the field and refine it for storage in a [Symbiota](http://symbiota.org/docs/) powered database.
