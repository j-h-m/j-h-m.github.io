# About me 

I'm a software developer in Tennessee. I have volunteered on a few projects with The Herbarium Consortium at UTC in Chattanooga. [CapPow](https://github.com/CapPow) and myself are working on a pair of applications for field research.
One is a data processing application powered by Python and another is a Xamarin Forms project that will result in an Android and iOS application.
