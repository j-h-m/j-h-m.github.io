# About me

My professional experience revolves around Microsoft Tech. Technologies that pique my interest are Xamarin, Tensorflow (no experience here... yet), .NET Core, and Microsoft's Hololens Tech (would <3 to test :P).

# Notable Projects

# Goals

 - Learning a handful of programming languages well.
    - C#
    - F# (or maybe another functional language... still deciding)
    - Python
    - Javascript
    - C/C++ (and valgrind abuse...)

 - Completing the [OMSCS](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) program.
 
 - Becoming a [Hacker](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) ... maybe not in the literal open-source sense, but his method of learning is a great guide for anyone, I believe.
