# About me

I'm currently employed at Barcom, Inc. in Tennessee. My professional work is closed-source so none of it will appear here. My professional experience revolves around .NET and Microsoft's Sql Server. Most of my repos are either volunteer projects or something I need to have easy-access to on multiple machines.
