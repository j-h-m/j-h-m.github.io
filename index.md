# About me

I'm currently employed at Barcom, Inc. in Tennessee. My professional work is closed-source so none of it will appear here. My professional experience revolves around .NET and Microsoft's Sql Server. Technologies that pique my interest are Xamarin, Tensorflow (no experience here... yet), .NET Core, and Microsoft's Hololens Tech (would <3 to test :P).

# Notable Projects

# Goals

 - Learning a handful of programming languages well.
    - C#
    - F# (or maybe another functional language... still deciding)
    - Python
    - Javascript
    - C/C++ (and valgrind abuse...)

 - Completing the [OMSCS](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) program.
 
 - Becoming a [Hacker](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) ... maybe not in the literal open-source sense, but his method of learning is a great guide for anyone, I believe.
