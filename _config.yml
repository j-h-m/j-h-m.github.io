  I am a Graduate student studying Cyber Secruity at UTC as a member of the CyberCorps program.
  The projects related to Botany were in relation to cross-field collaborative research and tool building between Computer Science and Biology. I worked on these as an Undergraduate.
  My current research interests are Cyber Security, Data Science, ML, and AI. I also enjoy building my own networking and workstation systems and learning about hardware. Using operating systems such as Linux, PfSense, Windows, and more.
  It's safe to say I have a tech addiction at this point.

          A desktop app for Windows, Linux, and Mac, written using Python Qt. It incorporates DNN vision algorithms to detect and correct issues in specimen images. I helped write a multithreading library for this app to run models/tasks simultaneously.
